      <ul>
        <li>Muslim theory</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Allah created everything e.g. balance (night & day, land & sea)</li>
          <li>Allah intended, planned and designed the Universe’s creation</li>
          <li>Allah created all living things</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Big Bang Theory</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Belief that the Universe began 14 billion years ago, when matter condensed and began to expand</li>
          <li>This expansion continues today at a slower rate</li>
          <li>Stars and planets formed by matter cooling</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Muslim response to Big Bang Theory (Scientific explanations)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Big Bang fills in the gaps of Muslim theories</li>
          <li>Scientific explanations give them a better understanding of Allah’s creation</li>
          <li>The Qur’an has similar accounts of creation e.g. “we are its expander”</li>
          <li>However, some feel it does contradict Islamic theories as it questions whether Allah planned the creation</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Gift or Commodity</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Some Muslims feel humans are the must important part of the creation, they free the universe was created FOR them</li>
          <li>Some feel the universe was a gift, so they should care for the universe as stewards (Kalifahs). They must look after the universe to get to Jannah (Paradise)</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p className="heading">Sanctity of Life</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Belief that life is special and holy</li>
        <li>Determines how Muslims act/behave as well as their view on some issues </li>
        <li>Qur’an</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Suggests it is wrong to take a life away as it is holy</li>
          <li>Life shouldn’t be taken away as Allah created it</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Muslim teachings</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Life is holy as Allah created it</li>
          <li>All life should be respected and not harmed</li>
          <li>All life is holy, all human lives are equal</li>
          <li>Allah created all life so can take it away too</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p className="heading">Origins of Human Life</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Theory of Evolution</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Darwin published the theory in 1859, arguing that human life developed gradually over millions of years from simple life forms to more complex forms</li>
          <li>The strongest characteristics & features survive, and weakest die out – natural selection</li>
          <li>Survival of the fittest – used to describe species being best suited to their environment</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Muslim responses</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Most Muslims (& other religious & non-religious people) feel that science offers more believable explanations for the world than religion</li>
          <li>Most Muslims try to adapt their beliefs to include both religious and scientific aspects</li>
          <li>The Qur’an says Allah made humans from clay </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p className="heading">Sanctity of Life vs. abortion</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Abortion is the deliberate termination of a pregnancy</li>
        <li>Arguments</li>
        <ul>
          <li>For abortion: the lesser of 2 evils (suicide, death caused by birth or bad parenting/upbringing)</li>
          <li>Against abortion: may lead to a “slippery slope” allowing other “forms of murder”, also all forms of life were created by Allah & taking it away is sinful (Sanctity of life)</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Ensoulment</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The Qur’an describes that 40-120 days after conception is when soul enters the foetus’ body</li>
          <li>Often Muslims allow abortion before this point to preserve Sanctity of Life if the mother will be harmed or was raped etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Non-religious arguments & Muslim responses</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Abortion is the women’s personal decision</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Muslims would say abortion is wrong as all life was created by Allah and it is His decision as to when He can take it away</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Some parents may not be financially or mentally ready</li>
          <ul>
            <li>“Do not kill your child for fear of poverty” – suggests Allah will help</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Individual circumstances should be considered & the decision be made based on this (situation ethics)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Some Muslims feel abortion is acceptable if the mother’s life is in danger or in case or rape as it upholds the mother’s Sanctity of Life</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p className="heading">Death & the Afterlife (Akhirah)</p>

          <li>The world will end when Allah decides</li>

        </ul>

        <li>Responses to arguments</li>

          <li>Paranormal activity e.g. ghosts - Muslims reject these ideas</li>
          <li>Death can’t be the end (logic) - Muslims agree due to Jannah & Jahannam otherwise life is meaningless</li>
          <li>Rewards for living a good life- Muslims agree as Jannah is a reward for good lives</li>
          <li>Comfort - Idea of the afterlife gives Muslims comfort </li>

        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p className="heading">Arguements Against Life after Death</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Euthanasia is the painless killing of a terminally ill people</li>
        <li>Types</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Voluntary</b> – a patient requests their life to be ended</li>
          <li><b>Assisted suicide</b> – when a person is given the needs to end their own life</li>
          <li><b>Non-voluntary</b> – ending someone’s life without asking, as you think it is what they would have wanted (if they are unable to ask)</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Non-religious arguments for euthanasia</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Many atheists would argue euthanasia is the kindest and least painful way to end a life of a terminally ill person</li>
          <li>Humanist would allow euthanasia if the person made their own decision without external persuasion – the decision should be available especially to terminally ill patients</li>
          <li>Situation ethics – the action most loving should happen even if it means ending a life early</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Muslim teachings </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Suffering is a test of faith and part of life</li>

          <li>All life is sacred, so it is vital to care for the ill </li>
          <li>No soul can die until Allah decides</li>
          <li>Allah created everything so is the only authority that can decide when it ends</li>
          <li>Euthanasia is always wrong as life is sacred and holy</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p className="heading">Issues in the Natural World</p>

          <li>Global warming</li>
          <li>Use of natural resources</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Muslims should care for the world and not waste its resources because…</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Allah created the word and humans are the carers</li>
          <li>Allah gave humans a duty to be Khalifahs – stewards who care for the world</li>
          <li>After death everyone will be questions on any ill-treatment to the world</li>
          <li>Allah created the world with love so humans should treat it with love</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Use of animals for food & experimentation (arguments)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Animals were created by Allah and given to humans as a food source</li>
          <li>Animals exist for human benefit but should be treated with respect and kindness as Allah’s creation</li>
          <li>The Qur’an says “Allah who made for you the grazing animals upon which you ride and some of you eat”</li>
          <li>Some Muslims chose to go vegetarian or vegan as they believe it is respectful to Allah’s creation</li>
          <li>Utilitarianism – “the greatest happiness for the greatest number”, this may be used to argue the benefit of using animals for food & experimentation</li>
        </ul>
