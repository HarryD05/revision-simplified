        <li>Each stakeholder is impacted in a different way e.g.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Users</b> - How might they be helped by the service? How might the service affect younger/older people or those who are vulnerable?</li>
          <li><b>Organisation who owns service</b> - What are their responsibilities? Who should they be protecting? How might they profit/benefit from providing the service? What do they have to make sure they do e.g. GDPR?</li>

        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p className="heading">Environmental impacts</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Natural resources</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Devices use lots of raw materials</li>
          <li>Plastic comes from crude oil, precious metals (e.g. gold, silver, copper) only occur naturally in small quantities</li>
          <li>Extracting their materials uses lots of energy, creates pollution & depletes natural resources</li>
        </ul>

        <li><b>Energy use</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Billions of devices global consume large amounts of electricity</li>
          <li>Electricity is often from non-renewables, causing a lot of pollution</li>
          <li>Computers generate heat and require cooling e.g. in server rooms power-hungry air-conditioning is required</li>
          <li>Devices waste a lot of energy, leaving them on when idle etc.</li>
          <li>Data centres use 2% of global energy, have to be left on 24-hours a day</li>
        </ul>

        <li><b>E-waste</b> <em>(disposal of electronics)</em></li>
        <ul>
          <li>20-50 million tonnes of waste is produced globally, annually with discarded electronics</li>
          <li>Modern technology has a very short life span before they break or need upgrading </li>
          <li>Electronic companies provide short warranties, market new devices & make replacements cheaper than repairs</li>
          <li>E-waste is usually sent to LICs e.g. African & Asian countries where it ends up in landfill, toxic chemicals can leak into water or harm wildlife</li>
          <li>Waste Electric & Electronic Equipment (WEEE) tackle the e-waste issues by promoting safe disposal & promote reuse & recycling</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
